# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
>This assignment aims to provide insights into how real-world business challenges are addressed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Specifically, it focuses on risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector, demonstrating how data analysis can mitigate the risk associated with lending.


## General Information
### Business Objectives
As the largest online loan marketplace, the company offers personal, business, and medical procedure financing with competitive interest rates and a user-friendly online interface. However, lending to "risky" applicants poses the greatest financial risk, known as credit loss, which occurs when borrowers default on their loans.

Identifying these risky loan applicants is crucial for reducing credit loss. The goal of this case study is to identify such applicants through EDA. By understanding the driving factors behind loan default, the company can enhance its portfolio management and risk assessment processes.

### Business Understanding
You are employed by a consumer finance company specializing in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When evaluating loan applications, the company must make decisions based on the applicant's profile. There are two primary risks associated with these decisions
1) Loss of Business: If a potential borrower is likely to repay the loan but is denied approval, the company loses business  opprtunities.
2) Financial Loss: If a borrower is unlikely to repay the loan, approving it may result in financial losses for the company.

The objective is to identify patterns indicating whether a person is likely to default on a loan. Understanding these patterns enables the company to take appropriate actions such as denying the loan, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates to risky applicants.

Loan Decision Scenarios
When a person applies for a loan, the company can take two types of decisions:
1) Loan Acceptance: If the company approves the loan, there are three possible outcomes:
Fully Paid: The applicant fully repays the loan amount (principal and interest).
Current: The applicant is in the process of repaying the loan and has not defaulted.
Charged-off: The applicant has defaulted by failing to repay instalments for an extended period.

2) Loan Rejection: The company rejects the loan application due to various reasons, resulting in no transactional history with those applicants.
